			<p> My name is Evgeniia Sindiukova and I am from Russia. In nowadays, I am studying ar Fanshawe College on Interactive Media Design Program. Studying in college brings me satisfaction and I hope that after graduation I will find the job in the current field. At the moment I almost don't do design parts because my level in the drawing is zero. Maybe in the summertime, if I will have free time (because I want to find some internship), I will spend it on self-education in drawing. The current program is the third education program in my life. I have a bachelor degree in Journalism from my country and also I have a post-graduation certificate in Marketing Management.

		   	Hello, my name is Olga. I am from the capital of the beautiful 
            country called Ukraine. I have graduated from Kyiv National
